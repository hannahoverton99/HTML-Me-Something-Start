               <h2>Why This Trip?</h2>
               <p>
                  In May of 2023, I went on an amazing roadtrip with my Dad. We started
                  in Arizona and worked our way up the coast until we got to Washington where my oldest
                  brother lives. The ultimate goal of this trip was to visit my brother and make
                  memories together along the way!

               <h3>Getting to Arizona</h3>
               <p>
                  The first step of the trip was getting myself from Springfield, MO (where I lived at the time)
                  to Phoenix, AZ via plane. My parents had driven to Phoenix from their home in Mimbres, New Mexico and 
                  were staying with my aunt. For context, my family is from Phoenix, and almost all of our
                  relatives live there. Once I landed in Phoenix, my parents picked me up, and we spent the rest of
                  the day visiting family and preparing my dad and I for the trip.

               <h3>Stop 1: Tonopah, Nevada</h3>
               <p>
                  The next day, my dad and I headed out on the road. This day was mainly just a lot of
                  driving. We headed North out of Phoenix towards Nevada. If you haven't been on this drive before, 
                  let me just tell you that there is literally nothing but desert and weird pieced together trailer homesteads
                  that look like they shouldn't be legal to live in dotting the landscape every so often. That night, we camped in Tonopah.
                  By camped, I mean we slept in our truck camper in the back parking lot of a random casino. Tonopah,
                  like much of Nevada, doesn't have a whole lot going for it, but we did play some penny slots.

               <h3>Stop 2: Lassen Volcanic National Park, California</h3>
               <p>
                  The next day, we drove from Tonopah through the rest of Nevada into California. This
                  drive was much more scenic, and we added to the ambience by listening to a few of our
                  favorite podcasts like <em>Small Town Dicks</em> and <em>Small Town Murder</em>. There's nothing
                  quite like driving through wilderness while listening to murder podcasts. That day we stopped to
                  camp at Lassen Volcanic National Park. This park is pretty high up in the mountains, so most of the 
                  campsites and areas were still under a bunch of winter snow. We found a beautiful campsite by a creek
                  and did some hiking through the forest where we saw a bunch of lava rocks and lava tubes.

               <h3>Stop 3: Redwood Forest and the Klamath River, California</h3>
               <p>
                  The next day we drove through California to the coast as our goal was to drive the rest
                  of the trip up the coast on I-5. Every person in their lifetime should drive at least part of the way up
                  I-5; It is one of the most beautiful and scenic drives, in my opinion. We stopped to take in the shoreline and then in the Redwood Forest to hike
                  through the fantastically enormous beast-trees. The Redwood Forest is my favorite place I have been in my life so far.
                  After hiking, we drove up the coast a ways to a campground <em>literally</em> five feet from the 
                  Klamath river.

               <h3>Stop 4: Fort Stevens State Park, Oregon and Cape Disapointment, Washington</h3>
               <p>
                  Next, we continued to drive North on the I-5 into Oregon to meet my brother at Fort Stevens State Park
                  to camp for a few days. 
                  This is some things we did while we were there:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Hiked around the park and played frisbee golf</li>
                     <li>Walked along the beach where we saw remenants of an old ship wreck</li>
                     <li>Did some quests from a book made by Oregon State University that I'll link <a href="https://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/education/quests" target="_blank">here</a>
                     </li>
                     <li>Visited a lighthouse at Cape Disapointment (it was not disappointing)</li>
                     <li>Visited an interpretation center at the spot where Louis and Clark made it to the West
                        Coast</li>
                     <li>Went to Astoria, OR which is also the place where the movie <em>The Goonies</em> was filmed</li>
                  </ul>

               <h3>Last Stop: Mcleary, Washington</h3>
               <p>After a few days of camping, we headed to my brother's house in Mcleary, Washington where I stayed there for four or
                  five days. The best part of this stay was going clamming for razor clams on the Olympic Coast! If you haven't been
                  clamming I recommend doing so because it is so much fun. You use a clam "gun", which is a tube that you shove
                  down into the sand when you find a clam hole and suction out sand so that you can dig down really fast with
                  your hands to grab the clam as it tries to dig away. We each got around 16 clams that we took home, prepared,
                  and made into clam chowder. The only downside to this excursion is that the wet sand on my rubber boots rubbed
                  against my shins and made them raw, so now I have weird scars that look like someone tried to cut my legs off *see picture below*.
                  Overall, though, it was my favorite trip I have been on so far!
